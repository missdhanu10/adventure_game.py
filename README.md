for this project, the idea is to focus on some key things that we need if want to make a working game:
1. One thing the game will need to do is to print messages for the player to describe what is happening. Like at the start of the example game, these lines are printed:
    You find yourself standing in an open field, filled with grass and yellow wildflowers.  
    Rumor has it that a wicked fairie is somewhere around here, and has been terrifying the nearby village.
2. Pausing between printing descriptions to add some delay
3. you'll need to get some input from the player, and then change what happens depending on what that input is
4. Make sure the player gives a valid input, your program should not crash on invalid input.
5. The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time (Used some randomness in game)
6. The game has conditions for winning and losing.
7. When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.
